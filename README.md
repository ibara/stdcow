stdcow
======
This is a standard library for the
[Cowgol](http://cowlark.com/cowgol/) programming language.

This is the ever-growing result of writing
[utilities in Cowgol](https://github.com/ibara/cowgol-utilities).
Subroutines found here are things that I found were missing in the
current Cowgol language.

You can use this library in your own Cowgol programs by adding
`include "stdcow.coh";` in your includes list, after the initial
`include "cowgol.coh";` and `include "file.coh";` lines.

License
-------
ISC License. See `stdcow.coh` for details. Importantly, the ISC
license is fully compatible with Cowgol's 2-clause BSD license.
