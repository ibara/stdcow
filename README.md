stdcow
======
This is a standard library for the
[Cowgol](http://cowlark.com/cowgol/) programming language.

This is the ever-growing result of writing
[utilities in Cowgol](https://github.com/ibara/cowgol-utilities).
Subroutines found here are things that I found were missing in the
current Cowgol language.
